description: 'Save your WorkFlowy session ID for CLI authentication'
---

The `wf login` command saves your WorkFlowy session cookie to a local config file. This allows the CLI to authenticate with WorkFlowy's API without passing credentials on every command.

## Basic Usage

```bash
wf login
```

The command will prompt you to paste your session ID, then save it to `~/.config/wf/config.json`.

## Interactive Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run the command">
    ```bash
    wf login
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow the instructions">
    The CLI will show you how to find your session cookie:
    
    ```
    ┌  wf login
    │
    ├  How to find it
    │  DevTools → Application → Cookies → workflowy.com → sessionid
    │
    ◆  Session ID: ********
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste your session ID">
    The input is masked for security. Paste the entire cookie value.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm success">
    ```
    └  Saved to ~/.config/wf/config.json
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Finding Your Session Cookie

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open WorkFlowy">
    Navigate to [workflowy.com](https://workflowy.com) and log in.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open DevTools">
    - **Chrome/Edge:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
    - **Firefox:** Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
    - **Safari:** Enable Developer menu in Preferences, then press `Cmd+Option+I`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to Cookies">
    - Go to the **Application** tab (Chrome/Edge) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
    - Expand **Cookies** in the sidebar
    - Click on `https://workflowy.com`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Copy the sessionid cookie">
    - Find the cookie named `sessionid`
    - Copy the entire **Value** column (not the name)
    - It should be a long alphanumeric string
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
The session ID is typically 32-40 characters long and looks like: `abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678`
</Tip>

## Configuration File

The login command saves your session ID to:

```
~/.config/wf/config.json
```

**Format:**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "your-session-id-here"
}
```

<Warning>
This file contains your authentication credentials. Keep it secure and never commit it to version control.
</Warning>

## Authentication Priority

The CLI checks for credentials in this order:

1. **Environment variable:** `WORKFLOWY_SESSION_ID`
2. **Config file:** `~/.config/wf/config.json`

If both are set, the environment variable takes precedence.

## Usage Scenarios

### Local Development (Recommended)

Use `wf login` to store your session ID permanently:

```bash
wf login
wf -o workflowy.md
wf fetch -o data.json
```

### CI/CD Pipelines (Recommended)

Use the environment variable instead of `wf login`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/backup.yml
env:
  WORKFLOWY_SESSION_ID: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOWY_SESSION_ID }}

steps:
  - name: Export WorkFlowy
    run: npx workflowy-scraper -o workflowy.md
```

<Tip>
Store `WORKFLOWY_SESSION_ID` as a secret in your CI platform (GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, etc.).
</Tip>

### One-Time Commands

For quick operations without saving credentials:

```bash
WORKFLOWY_SESSION_ID=abc123 wf -o workflowy.md
```

## Session Expiration

WorkFlowy session cookies typically last **~6 months**. When your session expires:

1. You'll receive authentication errors when running commands
2. Simply run `wf login` again with a fresh session cookie
3. For CI, update the secret with a new session ID

<Note>
The CLI doesn't validate your session ID when you run `wf login`. You'll only get an error when you try to fetch data with an invalid or expired session.
</Note>

## Cancelling Login

Press `Ctrl+C` or `Esc` to cancel the login flow:

```
◆  Session ID: 
│
◇  Login cancelled.
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Keep your session ID private">
  Never share your session ID or commit the config file to version control. It grants full access to your WorkFlowy account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use environment variables in CI">
  Store the session ID as a secret in your CI platform rather than hardcoding it in configuration files.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Rotate regularly">
  Even though sessions last ~6 months, consider rotating your session ID periodically for security.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Revoke if compromised">
  If your session ID is exposed, log out of WorkFlowy (or change your password) to invalidate all sessions.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Error Handling

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Empty session ID">
  ```
  Session ID cannot be empty.
  ```
  
  **Solution:** Paste a valid session ID (it should be 32-40 characters).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Permission denied writing config">
  ```
  Failed to write config file
  ```
  
  **Solution:** Ensure you have write permissions for `~/.config/wf/`. The CLI will create the directory if it doesn't exist.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Verifying Your Session

After logging in, test that your session works:

```bash
wf fetch -o test.json
```

If successful, your session ID is valid and you can run any command without re-authenticating.
