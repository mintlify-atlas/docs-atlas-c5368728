## Install the Package

WorkFlowy Scraper is available as an npm package. Choose your preferred package manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm install -g workflowy-scraper
```

yarn global add workflowy-scraper
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add -g workflowy-scraper
```

```bash bun
bun install -g workflowy-scraper
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The `-g` flag installs the package globally, making the `wf` command available system-wide.

npx wf
# or
