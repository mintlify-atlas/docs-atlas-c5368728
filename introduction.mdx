## What is WorkFlowy Scraper?

WorkFlowy Scraper is a CLI tool that lets you export your personal [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) data as Markdown or JSON. Since WorkFlowy doesn't offer a public API or bulk export feature, this tool uses their internal API to give you complete access to your data.

## Why use WorkFlowy Scraper?

## Key Features

- **Multiple Output Formats**: Export as Markdown or JSON
- **Powerful Filtering**: Search by contains, exact match, starts-with, or regex patterns
- **Full Tree Access**: Access your entire outline including shared and team trees
- **File or Stdout**: Write to files or pipe output to other commands
- **Local Caching**: Fetch data once and filter it locally for faster iterations
- **Programmatic API**: Use as a library in your own TypeScript/JavaScript projects

## How It Works

The scraper authenticates using your WorkFlowy session cookie and fetches your entire outline via their internal API. You can then:

1. Export everything or filter by node name patterns
2. Output as Markdown (default) or JSON format
3. Write to a file or stdout for piping to other tools
4. Cache data locally to avoid repeated API calls

<Note>
  WorkFlowy Scraper performs a depth-first search across your entire tree. When a node matches your filter pattern, that node and its complete subtree are included in the output.
</Note>

## Quick Example

```bash
# Export everything as Markdown
wf

# Export a specific node and its subtree
wf "Meeting Notes" --exact -o notes.md

# Export as JSON
wf --json -o workflowy.json

# Filter with regex
wf "^Project.*2026$" --regex
```
